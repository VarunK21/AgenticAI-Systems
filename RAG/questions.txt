The case involves a dispute with the plaintiff, Mr. Salem Abdullah Mohammed Salem Al-Bisher (سالم عبدالله محمد سالم البشر), and is being reviewed under labor law regulations. The document references the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant, governed by Kuwait's labor law in the private sector, and discusses the legal framework for terminating the employment relationship. It is part of proceedings in case number 0/1410, scheduled for a hearing on 15/11/1991.

Legal Proceedings:

The case is being presented before an expert panel, specifically Expert A / Fahd Al-Hadiyah.
The defense refers to the initial lawsuit and the submitted memorandums to avoid repetition.
Defense Argument:

The defense argues that an acknowledgment (or agreement) signed by the plaintiff is binding unless proven otherwise (e.g., under duress or coercion).
The plaintiff signed a settlement dated 17/5/1990, which aligns with the early retirement date of 7/4/1990. This indicates no delay or failure in disbursing the plaintiff's entitlements.

The document emphasizes that the claimant is responsible for proving their legal claims, and in the absence of evidence to support their case, the claim is dismissed.
